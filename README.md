Whitebox-crypto-AES
===================
![Build Status](https://github.com/ph4r05/Whitebox-crypto-AES/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Whitebox cryptography AES implementation.

This repository contains a C++ implementation of:
 * Complete whitebox [AES]-128 scheme introduced by [Chow] et al [2]. Implements/uses input/output encodings, mixing bijections, external encodings.
 * Complete whitebox [AES]-128 scheme introduced by [Karroumi] [3] which uses an idea of dual AES ciphers (using a different generating polynomial for AES cipher) for creating a stronger AES whitebox scheme.
 * Implementation of the [BGE] Attack on [Chow]'s AES whitebox implementation found by [Billet] et al [4]. Attack uses whitebox AES generator to create a random instance of whitebox AES scheme with secret key K embedded in the implementation. The attack then recovers the secret key K from the tables representing the given instance. This BGE attack also breaks scheme proposed by [Karroumi] what I found out while working on my [diploma] thesis.
 
The implementation contains:
 * Whitebox AES code generator in both [Chow] and [Karroumi] schemes. It generates a randomized whitebox AES instance with embedded encryption key K which can be used either for encryption or for decryption. Instance can be serialized to a file. 
 * Code for running generated whitebox AES instance for encryption/decryption.
 * BGE key recovery attack on a generated whitebox AES instance.
 * Unit tests.
 
You also might be interested in my [Java] implementation of the Chow's whitebox AES scheme.
In my [diploma] thesis I suggest modifications and improvements for a new whitebox-suited symmetric-key encryption algorithm based on AES.

cd build-debug
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
```

Usage
=====

The project contains basic Whitebox AES cipher core - for encrypting / decrypting one single AES block.

In order to demonstrate the basic usage there has been implemented:
 - [PKCS5] padding, so plaintext input does not have to be byte aligned to the length of the AES block. Implemented in `EncTools`.
 - [ECB] encryption mode
 - [CBC] encryption mode

The implementation of the PKCS5, ECB, CBC is for demonstration/academic purposes as it may leak information via
side channels (i.e., timing, memory access patterns)

Note the Padding can be used only if External encodings are not used.
Otherwise the input / output has to be by definition padded to the block size
so the ExtIO encoding can be removed before operation.

The project contains demo BGE attack in the target `./testing`.

There are also some tests implemented using [GTest] in the target `./gtesting`.

The target `./main` contains basic runnable main with few options - allows to use
the WBAES from the command line.

Usage:
```

./main --load-tables /tmp/aes-table --extEnc=0 --input-files /tmp/aes-table --pkcs5=1 --cbc=1 -o /tmp/aes-table.enc

# Load existing WBAES tables and decrypt previously encrypted file
./main --load-tables /tmp/aes-table --extEnc=0 --input-files /tmp/aes-table.enc --pkcs5=1 --cbc=1 -o /tmp/aes-table.dec --decrypt=1

# Compare original and dec(enc(original))
diff /tmp/aes-table /tmp/aes-table.dec
