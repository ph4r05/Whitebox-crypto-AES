A Tour of NTL: Summary of Changes 
</p>
</h1>

<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
2013.02.15: Changes between NTL 5.5.2 and 6.0
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Replaced the old template-like macros for vectors, matrices,
and pairs with true template classes: <tt>Vec&lt;T&gt;</tt>,
<tt>Mat&lt;T&gt;</tt>, and <tt>Pair&lt;S,T&gt;</tt>.

<p>
For backwards compatibilty, all the names that were used
in previous versions (e.g., <tt>vec_ZZ_p</tt>, <tt>mat_ZZ_p</tt>)
have been replaced with appropriate typedefs.

<p>
For many years, I resisted the temptation of using templates,
because compiler support was very inconsistent.
But that no longer seems to be the case.

<p>
This change, while rather sweeping, should create very few,
if any, incompatibilities with existing software.
The biggest issue would be for software that uses the
old template-like macros: such macro invocations can simply be
replaced with appropriate typedefs.

<p>
<li>
Made the conversion interface more complete and uniform.
Also, using template notation, one can and should now write
<tt>conv&lt;ZZ&gt;(a)</tt> instead of <tt>to_ZZ(a)</tt>
(for backward compatibility, all the old names <tt>to_XXX</tt>
are still there, but many new conversions are not available
under these old names).


<p>
There are many new conversions provided.
Moreover, whenever there is a conversion from a ring <i>R</i>
to a ring <i>S</i>, there is a corresponding, coefficiet-wise
conversion from the polynomial ring <i>R[X]</i> to the
polynomial ring <i>R[X]</i>.

<p>
In addition, using the template mechanism, there are
generic conversions for vectors and matrices.
For example, if there is a conversion from <tt>S</tt> to <tt>T</tt>,
then there is automatically a corresponding component-wise
conversion from <tt>Vec&lt;S&gt;</tt> to <tt>Vec&lt;T&gt;</tt>.


<p>
<li>
Introduced a more general mechanism for accessing <tt>GF2</tt>'s
in packed structures via indexing (see the class 
<tt>ref_GF2</tt> in the <tt>GF2</tt> module).

<p>
<li>
Employed ideas from David Harvey to make the single-precision 
FFT faster (about twice as fast in many cases).
This speeds up many higher-level operations.


<p>
<li>
Fixed all known bugs.


</ul>



<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
2009.08.14: Changes between NTL 5.5.1 and 5.5.2
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
New routines <tt>MulAddTo</tt> and <tt>MulSubFrom</tt>
for computing <tt>x += a*b</tt> and <tt>x -= a*b</tt>,
where <tt>x</tt> and <tt>a</tt> are <tt>ZZ</tt>'s and
<tt>b</tt> is a <tt>ZZ</tt> or a <tt>long</tt>.
In the case where <tt>b</tt> is a <tt>long</tt>,
this may be much faster than writing 
<tt>mul(t, a, b); add(x, x, t)</tt>.
See <a href="ZZ.txt">ZZ.txt</a> for details.

These new routines are used in a number of places in
NTL to get faster algorithms (for example, the <tt>LLL</tt> routine).

<li>
Fixed a relatively benign indexing bug in <tt>GF2EX</tt>
discovered by Berend-Benjamin Tams using the <tt>valgrind</tt> tool.




</ul>

<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
2009.05.05: Changes between NTL 5.5 and 5.5.1
</h3>

<ul>
<li> If using GMP (via either <tt>NTL_GMP_LIP</tt>
or <tt>NTL_GMP_HACK</tt>), then the new version (4.3.0) of
GMP implements the <tt>XGCD</tt> functionality differently,
so that the coefficients do not always agree with those returned by
the classical extended Euclidean algorithm.
This version of NTL corrects the coefficients, so that the
"classical" coefficients are always produced, regardless
of GMP's implementation. 
This version of NTL also works
around a bug in GMP 4.3.0's <tt>XGCD</tt> code
(although that bug should be fixed in GMP 4.3.1).

<li>
The <tt>configure</tt> script has been slightly modified:
there is a new configuration variable <tt>DEF_PREFIX</tt>,
whose value can be used to set <tt>PREFIX</tt>, <tt>GMP_PREFIX</tt>,
and <tt>GF2X_PREFIX</tt> in one stroke.
Also, the (somewhat esoteric) <tt>configure</tt> variables
<tt>GMP_LIBDIR</tt>, <tt>GMP_INCDIR</tt>,
<tt>GF2X_LIBDIR</tt>, and <tt>GF2X_INCDIR</tt>
have slightly different meanings now.

</ul>
</h3>

<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
2009.04.08: Changes between NTL 5.4.2 and 5.5
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Added the ability to generate a <i>shared</i> library
(with help from Tim Abbott). <a href="tour-unix.html#shared">Details.</a>

<li>
Fixed some standardization issues
(with help from Tim Abbot):
default location of installed documentation files now conforms
to standards; use of <tt>EOF</tt> now conforms to standards.

<li>
Added a callback mechanism to NTL's error reporting function.
See <tt>ErrorCallback</tt> in <a href="tools.txt">tools.txt</a>.

<li>
Added support for the <tt>gf2x</tt> library for speeding up
arithmetic in <tt>GF2X</tt> (with help from Emmanuel Thom&eacute;).
<a href="tour-gf2x.html">Details.</a>

<li>
In conjuction with the above, I also changed the
<tt>GF2X</tt> so that it works better with very large polynomials:
large blocks of memory are released, recursive HalfGCD algorithms
are used for large polynomials.


<li>
Fixed a bug in <tt>void TraceMod(zz_p&amp; x, const zz_pX&amp; a, const zz_pXModulus&amp; F)</tt> (reported by Luca De Feo).

<li>
Fixed a performance issue in various versions of <tt>SetCoeff</tt>
(reported by Luca De Feo).

<li>
Fixed the declaration of  <tt>mat_zz_p transpose(const mat_zz_p&amp; a)</tt>
(reported by Benoit Lacelle).
</ul>


<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
2008.03.05: Changes between NTL 5.4.1 and 5.4.2
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Fixed a bug in the <tt>sub(ZZ_pEX, ZZ_pE, ZZ_pEX)</tt>
and  <tt>sub(zz_pEX, zz_pE, zz_pEX)</tt> routines (reported by Charanjit Jutla).
Under certain circumstances, these could outout wrong answers.

</ul>

<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
2007.05.09: Changes between NTL 5.4 and 5.4.1
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Fixed rounding bug in <tt>expm1</tt> (reported by Paul Zimmermann).

<li>
Fixed memory leak in several LLL routines (reported by Friedrich Bahr).

<li>
Fixed infinite loop in several LLL routines
(this only occurred on machines, like x86, with double rounding).

<li>
Improved <tt>GF2X</tt> timing tests (suggested by Paul Zimmermann).

</ul>

<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
2005.03.24: Changes between NTL 5.3.2 and 5.4  
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
By default, NTL now compiles in ISO mode (using namespaces, etc.).
You can always revert to traditional mode by unsetting
the flag <tt>NTL_STD_CXX</tt> 
(either pass <tt>NTL_STD_CXX=off</tt> to the configure script,
or manually edit the <tt>config.h</tt> file).
<p>

<li>
Some bug fixes:

<ul>
<li>
The <tt>sqrt</tt> and <tt>log1p</tt> routines
for the <tt>RR</tt> class would produce incorrectly rounded
results in certain circumstances (although this only affected the relative
error of the result very marginally).
<li>
The <tt>SqrRootPrec</tt> routine for the <tt>RR</tt> class
could not be called, because it was defined incorrectly.
</ul>

<p>

Thanks to Paul Zimmermann for finding (and fixing) these bugs!
Paul has also validated NTL's <tt>RR</tt> class by cross-checking it with the
<a href="http://www.mpfr.org">MPFR</a> library.

<p>
<li>
Some performance enhancements:

<ul>
<li>
Added a new <tt>MulModPrecon</tt> inline function for 
computing <tt>(a * b) % n</tt> for single precision numbers,
when <tt>b</tt> and <tt>n</tt> are fixed for several computations.
On some platforms this can be twice as fast or more than the
old <tt>MulMod2</tt> routine.
This indirectly affects a lot of computations that are done via
homomorphic imaging (polynomial multiplication
over <tt>zz_p</tt>, <tt>ZZ_p</tt>, and <tt>ZZ</tt>,
matrix computations over <tt>zz_p</tt> and <tt>ZZ</tt>).

<li>
Rewrote the small prime FFT to take advantage of the new
<tt>MulModPrecon</tt>, and to be more cache friendly.

<li>
Improved the performance of the <tt>GF2X</tt> multiplication routine.
On some platforms, it can be twice as fast as the old one.
Thanks (again) to Paul Zimmermann for suggesting some of these
improvements and supplying some of the code.

</ul>

<p>
<li>
Miscellany:

<ul>
<li>
Rewrote several of the installation scripts in Perl (the old shell
scripts were getting too messy to maintain).
However, the syntax for all of the command-line interfaces
remains identical.

</ul>
 




</ul>

<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
2004.05.21: Changes between NTL 5.3.1 and 5.3.2
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Some bug fixes.

<p>
<li>
Re-wrote <tt>SqrRootMod</tt> to make it run faster.

</ul>



<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
2002.12.17: Changes between NTL 5.3 and 5.3.1
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Fixed a bug affecting the <tt>BuildIrred</tt> routines
for <tt>ZZ_pEX</tt> and <tt>zz_pEX</tt>.
</ul>

<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
2002.07.05: Changes between NTL 5.2 and 5.3
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Minimized and isolated constructs that do not adhere to <tt>C</tt>/<tt>C++</tt> 
standards,
and added flags <tt>NTL_CLEAN_INT</tt> and <tt>NTL_CLEAN_PTR</tt>
which force stricter compliance with these standards 
<a href="tour-impl.html">[more details]</a>.

<p>
<li>
Added functions <tt>IsWhiteSpace</tt>, <tt>CharToIntVal</tt>,
and <tt>IntValToChar</tt>  to the <tt>tools</tt> module
<a href="tools.txt">[more details]</a>.

<p>
<li>
Added methods <tt>allocated</tt>, <tt>position1</tt> to generic vector classes
<a href="vector.txt">[more details]</a>.

<p>
<li>
Added method <tt>allocated</tt> to the class <tt>vec_GF2</tt>
<a href="vec_GF2.txt">[more details]</a>.

<p>
<li>
Added conversion routines from unsigned int/long to int, long, float, and double
<a href="conversions.txt">[more details]</a>.

<p>
<li>
Added routines <tt>AddPrec</tt>, <tt>SubPrec</tt>, etc., to the <tt>RR</tt>
module, and declared the practice of directly  assigning to the variable
<tt>RR::prec</tt> obsolete
<a href="RR.txt">[more details]</a>.

<p>
<li>
Fixed a number of minor bugs.

</ul>



<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
2001.07.19: Changes between NTL 5.1a and 5.2
</h3>

<p>

<ul>
<li>
Implemented Mark van Hoeij's new algorithm for factorining polynomials
with rational coefficients.
This new algorithm is much more efficient than the previous algorithm
used by NTL, and is the default (one can switch back to the old algorithm
with a run-time switch).
<p>
<a href="ZZXFactoring.txt">[documentation]</a>
<p>
<a href="tour-time.html">[performance measurements]</a>
<p>

<li>
Added routines <tt>LLL_plus</tt> that are just like the all-integer 
<tt>LLL</tt> routines, except that they return the exact values of the
squared lengths of the Gramm-Schmidt basis vectors.
This is useful in implementing van Hoeij's algorithm.
<a href="LLL.txt">[more details]</a>.
<p>

<li>
Made a small change to <tt>quad_float.c</tt> to make it compile
under  gcc version 3.0
without errors.
This is the <i>one</i> place in NTL where I resort to just a little
assmebly code (but only on x86/Linux platforms), and wouldn't you know it,
this is the <i>one</i> place where gcc 3.0 had problems.
<p>

<li>
Made a small change to the procedure for generating a distribution,
so that now all files in the "tar" file comprising the distribution
come without any annoyingly excessive access control restrictions.
<p>

<li>
Changed the version numbering scheme so that it is now closer to
"standard practice".
This is version "5.2".
Any small bug fixes to this version will be named "5.2.1", "5.2.2", etc.
Also, macros are now defined so that the numerical components
of the version number are available to the programmer.
<a href="version.txt">[more details]</a>.


</ul>


<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
2001.06.08: Changes between NTL 5.0c and 5.1a
</h3>

<p>
Some minor fixes and additions.
<p>
Completely backward compatible.
<p>

<ul>

<li>
Added a routine <tt>LatticeSolve()</tt> for finding integer
solutions to linear systems of integer equations.
<a href="LLL.txt">[more details]</a>

<p>
<li>
Modified the stragey used by the <tt>LLL()</tt> and <tt>image()</tt>
routines in the <a href="LLL.txt">LLL package</a> to deal
with linear dependencies.
The new strategy guarantees better worst-case bounds on the
sizes of intermediate values.
I'm not sure if it will have any serious practical impact, though.

<p>
<li>
Added some "partial ISO modes" so that one can use
some of the features of Standard <tt>C++</tt>,
even if ones compiler does not yet support all of the features.
<a href="tour-stdcxx.html">[more details]</a>

<p>
<li>
Bug fix: routine <tt>determnant()</tt> in <tt>mat_GF2.h</tt>
was not visible to the linker because of a typo in <tt>mat_GF2.c</tt>.

<p>
<li>
Made a "smarter" script for selecting the <tt>GetTime()</tt>
function.
This fixes an installation problem on Cygwin/Windows 95 platforms.
I hope it doesn't create more problems than it solves, though.

<p>
<li>
Added some extra documentation for installation under
Windows/MS Visual <tt>C++</tt>. 
<a href="tour-win.html">[more details]</a>

<p>
<li>
Changed some names like <tt>c_lip.c</tt> to <tt>c_lip_impl.h</tt>.
This should avoid some potential installation problems.

<p>
<li>
Throw away first 256-bytes of arc4 streams to improve quality of
the pseudo-random number generator.
This may change the precise behavior of some  programs.

<p>
<li>
Other minor, internal modifications.

</ul>




<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
2001.02.19: Changes between NTL 5.0b and 5.0c
</h3>

<p>
Fixed a naming problem in the Windows distribution.
The Unix distribution is unaffected.


<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
2001.02.19: Changes between NTL 5.0a and 5.0b
</h3>

<p>
Fixed a typo in <tt>vec_ulong.c</tt> that causes a compile error
on some platforms.


<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
2001.02.19: Changes between NTL 4.3a and 5.0a
</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
I've now re-structured NTL so that one can use
either 'traditional' LIP or GMP as the <i>primary</i> long integer package.
Doing this introduced some (minor) backward incompatabilies in
the programming interface, so there is also a 'third way' -- you
can use GMP as a <i>supplemental</i> long integer package (as in NTL 4.3), 
getting
many (but not all) of the performance benefits of GMP, while
maintaining <i>complete</i> backward compatability with the traditional
long integer package.
This 'third way' is not highly recommended -- it is only intended
as a backward compatabilty hack.

<p>
Even if you do not use GMP, you should 
<a href="tour-gmp.html">read about using NTL with GMP</a> so
that you can write code that works with either the traditional or GMP
long integer packages.
<p>
<li>
Added a <tt>ZZ</tt> to unsigned long conversion routine.
<a href="conversions.txt">[more details]</a>
<li>
Added new vector classes <tt>vec_ulong</tt> (vectors
of unsigned longs) and <tt>vec_vec_ulong</tt>.
<a href="tour-modules.html">[more details]</a>
<li>
Some minor bug fixes:  under some unusual circumstances, a memory
allocation error could be erroneously raised; I also added a patch 
that works around a bug in v3.0.1 of GMP.
<li>
Some internal cleansing, minimizing the use of non-standard constructs.
</ul>


<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
Changes between NTL 4.2a and 4.3a
</h3>

This is backward compatible with previous versions.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Improved the performance of <tt>ZZ_pX</tt> arithmetic when using 
GMP.
The GMP version is also more space efficient 
(the pre-computed tables are much smaller).
These improvements are most marked for very large <tt>p</tt> (several
thousand bits).

<p>
The only thing unsatisfactory about this state of affairs is that 
<i>vis a vis</i> the GMP version, the pure
LIP code is asymptotically slower by <i>more</i> than a constant factor,
and is is also less space efficient.
Perhaps I'll get around to rectifying this imbalance someday.
To do this, I need a sub-quadratic division with remainder routine for LIP.
At any rate, the differences only become seriously noticible when
<tt>p</tt> has more than a few thousand bits.

<p>

<li>
Some other small adjustments here and there.

</ul>

<p> <hr> <p>
<h3>
Changes between NTL 4.1a and 4.2a
</h3>

This is backward compatible with previous versions.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Hacked the big integer code so that NTL uses GMP
(the GNU Multi-Precision library).
This is done in such a way as to get most of the benefits of GMP
with a reasonable amount of effort, and while maintaining complete backward
compatability and minimizing the risk of introducing bugs.
Some arithmetic operations 
on some platforms may execute two to three times
faster if using GMP. <a href="tour-gmp.html">[more details]</a>
<li>
Simplified the installation procedure on Unix systems by
providing a simple configuration script so that setting 
various configuration variables can be done without
editing the <tt>makefile</tt> and  <tt>config.h</tt> file.
<a href="tour-unix.html">[more details]</a>
<li>
Added function <tt>GenGermainPrime</tt>
to efficiently generate random Germain primes, i.e., primes <i>p</i>
such that <i>2p+1</i> is also prime. <a href="ZZ.txt">[more details]</a>
<li>
Added a function <tt>random</tt> to generate random <tt>quad_floats</tt>.
<a href="quad_float.txt">[more details]</a>
<li>
Added an <tt>ifdef</tt> in <tt>tools.h</tt> that allows
one to suppress the declaration of <tt>min</tt> and <tt>max</tt>
functions in NTL client programs;
these were causing problems when writing 'Windows applications'.
<li>
Implemented a faster algorithm for initializing the
<tt>ZZ_p</tt> auxilliary data structures.
<li>
Polished up a few other minor things in the code and documentation.
</ul>

<p> <hr> <p>

<p>
<h3>
Changes between NTL 4.0a and 4.1a
</h3>
<p>

This is backward compatible with previous versions.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Made some changes that should make NTL compile smoothly
using any variation of the <tt>C++</tt> language between traditional and 
ISO Standard.
These changes do not affect the documented NTL interface or the
behaviour of NTL.

<li>
Added a flag <tt>NTL_STD_CXX</tt> in the <tt>config.h</tt> file.
Setting this flag causes all of NTL to be "wrapped" in namespace <tt>NTL</tt>,
and that part of the standard library used by NTL is "wrapped"
in namespace <tt>std</tt>.
This should greatly help with the <i>namespace pollution</i> problem.
<a href="tour-stdcxx.html">Go here</a> for more details.

</ul>

<p>
<h3>
Changes between NTL 3.9b and 4.0a
</h3>
<p>

This is backward compatible with previous version.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Attached the GNU General Public License to NTL.

<li>
Fixed two bugs:
<ul>
<li>
one in <tt>ReconstructRational</tt> which resulted in a crash on some inputs;
<li>
one in <tt>exp(RR)</tt> (and by implication in <tt>pow(RR,RR)</tt>),
which led to wrong answers on 64-bit machines when computing <tt>exp(x)</tt>
for <tt>x > 2^53</tt>.
</ul>

<li>
Increased some inconvenient limiting bounds, including a restriction on the 
FFT.

</ul>


<p> <hr> <p>

<p>
<h3>
Changes between NTL 3.9a and 3.9b
</h3>
<p>

This is a minor revision of 3.9a.

<ul>
<li>
Improved time and space efficiency of the HNF routine
(see <a href="HNF.txt"><tt>HNF.txt</tt></a>).
The old version was based on the description in Henri Cohen's book,
which was not really properly optimized.
</ul>



<p> <hr> <p>

<p>
<h3>
Changes between NTL 3.8b and 3.9a
</h3>
<p>

This is backward compatible with previous versions.

<ul>
<li>
Modified the installation script somewhat, adding
a <i>configuration wizard</i> that sets the flags in
<tt>config.h</tt> "automagically".
This works for the <a href="tour-unix.html">Unix version</a> only.

<li>
Improved the <tt>xdouble</tt> input/output and ascii to <tt>xdouble</tt>
conversion.
The old version could be a bit flaky when reading/writing
very large numbers.
The new I/O routines also attain better accuracy.

<li>
Improved conversion routines between <tt>xdouble</tt>
and <tt>ZZ</tt>/<tt>RR</tt>. 

<li>
Improved the <tt>RR</tt> output routine.
The new version should be more accurate and also 
completely platform independent.

<li>
Added the following routines to the <tt>RR</tt> package:
<pre>
   {Trunc,Floor,Ceil,Round}ToZZ, round
   RoundToPrecision, MakeRR
   random
</pre>
See <a href="RR.txt"><tt>RR.txt</tt></a> for details.

<li>
Improved the accuracy of <tt>quad_float</tt> input/output,
and the accuracy of conversion between <tt>quad_float</tt> and <tt>RR</tt>.

<li>
Made the timing function somewhat more robust.

<li>
Hacked the Unix installation script so that it works 
more smoothly with Cygnus tools under Windows.

<li>
Fixed a few other, small problems.
</ul>

<p> <hr> <p>

<p>
<h3>
Changes between NTL 3.8a and 3.8b
</h3>
<p>

This is a minor revision of 3.8a.

<ul>
<li>
Fixed a bug, a memory leak in routine <tt>gauss</tt> for <tt>mat_ZZ_pE</tt>
and <tt>mat_zz_pE</tt>.
<li>
Fixed a minor problem in <tt>config.h</tt>.
<li>
Tightened up some size checks, so that now some nice "size invariants"
are guaranteed, e.g., for a <tt>ZZ</tt> <tt>n</tt>,
<pre>
   NumBits(NumBits(n)) &lt;= NTL_BITS_PER_LONG-4
</pre>
Similarly for the type <tt>GF2X</tt>.
Of course, on most platforms, one will run out of memory before
these bounds are exceeded, but they are nevertheless convenient.
</ul>


<p> <hr> <p>

<p>
<h3>
Changes between NTL 3.7a and 3.8a
</h3>
<p>

This is backward compatible with previous versions.


<ul>
<li>
Added conversion routines from <tt>unsigned</tt> <tt>int</tt>
and <tt>unsigned</tt> <tt>long</tt> to 
<tt>ZZ</tt>, <tt>RR</tt>, <tt>xdouble</tt>, and <tt>quad_float</tt>.

<li>
Added routines <tt>GF2XFromBytes</tt> and <tt>BytesFromGF2X</tt>
for conversion between byte vectors and polynomials over <tt>GF(2)</tt>,
along with routines <tt>NumBits</tt> and <tt>NumBytes</tt>
for such polynomials.
See <a href="GF2X.txt"><tt>GF2X.txt</tt></a> for details.

<li>
Added a hack in the <tt>ZZX</tt> factorizer
to exploit polynomials of the form <tt>g(x^k)</tt>.
This can be disabled by setting the variable <tt>ZZXFac_PowerHack</tt>
to zero.
See <a href="ZZXFactoring.txt"><tt>ZZXFactoring.txt</tt></a>
for details.

<li>
Improved the hensel system solver <tt>solve1</tt>.
See <a href="mat_ZZ.txt"><tt>mat_ZZ.txt</tt></a> for details.

<li>
Changed documentation for <tt>RationalReconstruction</tt>
to reflect the Wang, Guy, Davenport bounds.
See <a href="ZZ.txt"><tt>ZZ.txt</tt></a> for details.

<li>
Improved the routine <tt>GenPrime</tt> a bit. 

<li>
Some other small tweaks here and there.
No real bug fixes.

<li>
Polished the documentation a bit, adding more examples.

</ul>

<h3>
Changes between NTL 3.6b and 3.7a

<li>
Added a "rational reconstruction" routine. 
See the routine <tt>ReconstructRational</tt> in <a href="ZZ.txt">ZZ.txt</a>.
<li>
Added another routine for solving linear systems over <tt>ZZ</tt>
that is based on Hensel lifting, rather than Chinese Remaindering.
It can be significantly faster in some cases.
See the routine <tt>solve1</tt> in <a href="mat_ZZ.txt">mat_ZZ.txt</a>).
<li>
Some performace tuning, especially CRT and polynomial interpolation code.
<li>
Various documentation corrections.
<li>
Added more "overflow checks" here and there to ensure programs crash gracefully
when certain things get too big.
<li>
Fixed a "benign" bug (i.e., it would never get triggered on any of today's
machines).
<li>
Removed references to <tt>&lt;malloc.h&gt;</tt>, which were unnecessary,
non-standard, and caused problems on some platforms.

<h3>
Changes between NTL 3.1b and 3.5a
</h3>
<p>

<b>Please note.</b> This version is <b>NOT</b> completely backward compatible.

<p>

Summary of changes:

<ul>

<li>
Improved performance of the "all integer" LLL routine.

<li>
Put in a better pseudo-random number generator,
and added ZZ/byte array conversions.

<li>
Improved performance of primality test, and added a 
more convenient routine <tt>GenPrime</tt>.

<li>
Overloaded NTL's vector placement "new" operator in a different
way to avoid conflicts with standard <tt>C++</tt> library.

<li>
Renamed many macros.

<li>
Renamed header files.

<li>
Made some changes to the packaging
the installation procedure.

</ul>

<p>
<b>Renamed Macros.</b>
I renamed many macros defined in NTL header files.

<p>
The reason is that I want to minimize namespace pollution.
Someday, NTL will be wrapped in a namespace, and when that happens
the only remaining namespace pollution problems will be caused by macros.
Eliminating all macros from NTL is not feasible.
Instead, all NTL defined macros now begin with the prefix "NTL_",
which reduces the namespace pollution to an ecceptable level.
You will probably not be affected by this, unless you
do some low level hacking using a macro like <tt>ZZ_NBITS</tt>
(now called <tt>NTL_NBITS</tt>), or unless you create your
own NTL vectors using a macro like <tt>ntl_vector_decl</tt>
(now called <tt>NTL_vector_decl</tt>).

<p>
For a complete list of affected names, see <a href="names.txt">names.txt</a>.

<p>
Adapting to this name change should be painless, as there is a 
program to translate source files from the old naming convention to the new.
The file "newnames.c", 
can be compiled as either a <tt>C</tt> or <tt>C++</tt>
program. 
The program is a "filter" that copies its input to its output,
replacing all the old macro names by the new macro names.
<p>
In the WinNTL distribibution, "newnames.c" is called 
"newnames.cpp" and is located in the directory
"newnames".


<p>
<b>Renamed header files.</b>
The names of header files themeselves pollute another (extra-linguitsic) namespace.
To alleviate this problem, the header files have been renamed.
Instead of
<pre>
   #include "foo.h"
</pre>
one now should write
<pre>
   #include &lt;NTL/foo.h&gt;
</pre>
The only exceptions are the old header files "ntl_vector.h",
"ntl_matrix.h", and "ntl_pair.h", which are now called
<tt>&lt;NTL/vector.h&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;NTL/matrix.h&gt;</tt>, and 
<tt>&lt;NTL/pair.h&gt;</tt>.

<p>
<b>Installation procedure.</b>
Now all
NTL flags like NTL_LONG_LONG, NTL_AVOID_FLOAT, etc., can  now be set
by editing the special file "include/NTL/config.h".
See details in that file.
The reason for this change is that this allows all of these settings
to be made when NTL is configured and built.
Clients of NTL will then automatically use consistent settings.
One should not set these flags on the compiler command line as previously.


<p>
Pentium/Linux people should no longer have to worry
about the NTL_X86_FIX flag. NTL now psychically deduces
the "right thing to do", although if its psychic abilities fail,
you can override it with flags in "include/NTL/config.h".

<p>
The "packaging" in the Unix distribution is slightly
different, but hopefully nicer.
Among other things, the tar file now unpacks into a sub-directory of the current directory.
See <a href="tour-unix.html">the unix installation section</a>
for more details.
The Windows zip file now also 
unpacks into  sub-directory.


<p>
<b>My apologies.</b>
Although these changes are minor, they will cause some NTL
users some inconvenience.
I apologize for this.
I really, really hope there are no more changes like this
(see my <a href="tour-roadmap.html">roadmap</a> of NTL's future).

<h3>
Changes between NTL 3.1a and 3.1b
</h3>
<p>

Defined functions <tt>div(GF2X,GF2X,GF2)</tt> and <tt>div(GF2X,GF2X,long)</tt>,
which had not been defined in earlier versions.
Affected file: <tt>GF2X.c</tt>.
Most programs never use this, and most linkers do not complain
if these are missing (but some do).

<p>
<h3>
Changes between NTL 3.0f and 3.1a
</h3>
<p>

This version is backward compatible with previous versions.

<p>

<ul>
<li>
Added floating point LLL routines based on Givens rotations,
instead of classical Gramm-Schmidt orthogonalization.
This is a more stable, but somewhat slower, method.
See <a href="LLL.txt">LLL.txt</a> for details.

<li>
Added support for irreducible trinomials and pentanomials
over GF(2). The <tt>GF2XModulus</tt> routines,
and by extension, the <tt>GF2E</tt> routines,
now exploit moduli of this special form.
The new routine <tt>BuildSparseIrred</tt> in <tt>GF2XFactoring</tt>
builds irreducibles of this form.

<li>
Also implemented a faster modular inversion routine
for <tt>GF2X</tt>, and improved the performance of <tt>ZZ_pX</tt>
multiplication for small degree polynomials.
</ul>

<h3>
Changes between NTL 3.0 and 3.0e
</h3>
<p>

<ul>
<li>
Fixed a bug affecting routines 
<pre>
   RandomBits, RandomBits_ZZ, RandomBits_long
</pre>
in module <tt>ZZ</tt>.
The only source files that are affected and require re-compilation are
<pre>
   ZZ.c, lip.c
</pre>

<li>
Note about names:
3.0a-c were "pre-releases", which makes the "first release" 3.0d,
and hence this bug fix 3.0e.
   
</ul>

<p>

<h3>
Changes between NTL 2.0 and 3.0
</h3>
<p>


<ul>

<li>
Added functionality:
<p>

<ul>

<li>
Added classes vec_GF2 and mat_GF2 for fast linear algebra over GF(2).

<li>
Added classes ZZ_pE, ZZ_pEX, zz_pE, zz_pEX, supporting polynomial
arithmetic over extension rings/fields over prime fields.

<li>
Added John Abbott's pruning heuristic to the ZZX factoring routine.

<li>
Speeded up multiplication in zz_pX for small p (this also helps
the ZZX factoring routine).

<li>
Added some some transcendental functions (e.g., exp, log, pi) to RR.

<li>
Added verbose mode and pruning to the XD and RR variants of LLL.

</ul>
<p>

<li>
Improved programming interface:
with this version, I've taken an the opportunity to 
give the programming interface a "professional facelift".
In previous releases, I've tried to maintain backward compatability
as much as possible, but to make the badly needed improvements
to the interface that I've made with this release, this was not
possible.
<p>
NTL 3.0 is not backward compatable with NTL 2.0.
<p>
I apologize to NTL users for this, but it is a bit of painful
medicine that should only be necessary to take just this one time
(but then as a <tt>C++</tt> programmer, you must already
be used to suffering ;-).
Just about all of the incompatabilities are detectable by the compiler.
See below for a detailed list of the changes and
some tips on making the transition.
<p>
The new interface is much more enjoyable to work with,
and I don't foresee any changes to the interace in the future.
Here is a broad overview of the changes:
<p>

<ul>
<li>
Added functional/operator notation consistently throughout NTL,
making it possible to write much more concise and readable code.
<li>
Got rid of automatic type conversions:  these cause just too
many problems.  But I've overloaded all of the basic arithmetic
operators and procedures so as to emulate a natural kind
of "type promotion" logic.  With these promotions, along with
a  full compliment of conversion functions, one hardly misses
the automatic conversions.
<li>
Got rid of the macros
<pre>
   vector(T), matrix(T), pair(T),
</pre>
which were causing too many name space problems.

<li>
Made assignment operators have the "correct" return type.
<li>
Introduced a more powerful and flexible mechanism for modulus changing.
<li>
Cleaned up numerous other minor problems.
</ul>

</ul>

<p>
<h4>
Compatibility
</h4>
<p>

Here is a detailed list of the changes to the programming 
interface.
<p>


<ul>

<li>
The names of the classes 
<pre>
   BB, BB_p, BB_pX
</pre>
have been changed to
<pre>
   GF2X, GF2E, GF2EX
</pre>

<li>
There is also a class <tt>GF2</tt> to represent GF(2).
Many of the functions relating to <tt>BB, BB_p, BB_pX</tt>
had argument and return-value types of type <tt>long</tt>
that are now of the more appropriate type <tt>GF2</tt>.
This change was needed so that the interface would be consistent
with that of the new classes
<pre>
   ZZ_pE, ZZ_pEX, zz_pE, zz_pEX.
</pre>

<li>
The explicit conversion operator from <tt>GF2X</tt> 
(the new <tt>BB</tt>) to <tt>GF2EX</tt> (the new <tt>BB_pX</tt>)
has different semantics: it now performs a coefficient lift,
instead of creating a constant polynomial.

<li>
The conversion operator "<tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>" has been retired.
Now instead of
<pre>
   x &lt;&lt; a; 
</pre>
one writes
<pre>
   conv(x, a);
</pre>
<p>
Operator "<tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>" is now used for shift operations.
<li>
Every conversion routine now has a corresponding functional version
which has the name <tt>to_T</tt>, where <tt>T</tt> is the result type.
These new names replace old names that were less consistent.
So instead of
<pre>
   x = Long(a);
</pre>
one writes
<pre>
   x = to_long(a);
</pre>


<li>
The names of the routines
<pre>
   ZZ_pInit, zz_pInit, zz_pFFTInit, GF2EInit
</pre>
have been changed to
<pre>
   zz_p::init, zz_p::init, zz_p::FFTInit, GF2E::init
</pre>

<li>
The names of the routines 
<pre>
   and, or, xor 
</pre>
for class <tt>ZZ</tt> have
changed to 
<pre>
   bit_and, bit_or, bit_xor, 
</pre>
because the new <tt>C++</tt>
standard defines these as reserved words.

<li>
The function <tt>LowBits</tt> for <tt>ZZ</tt> is now called <tt>trunc</tt>.

<li>
Polynomial inversion mod <tt>X^n</tt> has changed from <tt>inv</tt>
to <tt>InvTrunc</tt>.

<li>
Modular trace, norm, minimum polynomial and characteristic
polynomial have changed from
<pre>
   trace, norm, MinPoly, IrredPoly, CharPoly
</pre>
to
<pre>
   TraceMod, NormMod, MinPolyMod, IrredPolyMod, CharPolyMod
</pre>


<li>
For the class <tt>ZZX</tt>, the functions 
<pre>
   DivRem, div, rem, /, %, /=, %=
</pre>
have new semantics when dividing by non-monic polynomials.
The old semantics are provided by new routines 
<pre>
   PseudoDivRem, PseudoDiv, PseudoRem.
</pre>

<li>
The <tt>UpdateMap</tt> routines have slightly different semantics:
in versions &lt; 3.0, the output always had length n;
now high-order zeroes are stripped.

<li>
The classes <tt>ZZ_pBak</tt>, <tt>zz_pBak,</tt> etc.,  
have just slightly different semantics;  I can't imagine
any reasonable program detecting a difference.

<li>
The assignment operator and copy constructor for the class <tt>RR</tt>
have different semantics: they now produce exact copies, instead
of rounding to current precision.

<li>
All of the NTL compiler flags now start with <tt>NTL_</tt>
to avoid name space problems.

<li>
All of the files "zz_p.h", vec_zz_p.h", etc., have been eliminated.
Use instead the names "lzz_p.h", "vec_lzz_p.h", etc.

</ul>

<p>
<h4>
Tips on making the transition
</h4>
<p>

<ul>

<li>
Apply this <a href="sedscript.txt">sed script</a> to make
most of the necessary syntactic changes.

<li>
Re-compile old NTL programs with the flag 
<pre>
   -DNTL_TRANSITION
</pre>
See <a href="flags.txt">flags.txt</a> for details on how
this will help your compiler detect remaining incompatabilities.
In particular, any uses of operator <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>
in its old role as a conversion operator will cause the compiler
to raise an error.
You can then convert all of these to the new notation.

</ul>


<p>

<p>
<h3>
Changes between NTL 1.7 and 2.0
</h3>
<p>

<ul>
<li>
Implementation of classes BB (polynomials over GF(2))
and BB_pX (polynomials over GF(2^n)).

<li>
A more consistent and natural interface, including arithmetic operators
and a disciplined use of automatic conversion.
So now one can write
<pre>
   x = a * b + c;
</pre>
instead of 
<pre>
   mul(x, a, b);
   add(x, x, c);
</pre>
as one must in older versions of NTL.
The operator notation leads to somewhat less efficient code,
and one can always use the old notation in situations
where efficiency is critical.
Despite the new programming interface,
care has been taken to ensure backward compitability;
pre-existing programs that use NTL should still work.

<li>
Windows port.

<li>
Added compile-time flag that allows one to exploit 
"long long" data type if it exists (this especially helps on Pentium/Linux 
platforms).

<li>
Added compile-time flag to get better quad_float code on
Pentium/Linux platforms.

<li>
A few bug fixes and performance tuning.
</ul>

<h3>
Changes between NTL 1.5 and NTL 1.7
</h3>
<p>

<ul>
<li>
Incorporation of Keith Briggs' quadratic precision package.

<li>
Much faster and more robust lattice basis reduction,
including Schnorr-Horner "volume heuristic" for Block Korkin
Zolotarev reductions, and a new quadratic precision LLL variant
that is much more robust.

<li>
A few bug fixes.

</ul>


<p>
<hr>

<p>
<h3>
Changes between NTL 1.0 and NTL 1.5
</h3>
<p>


<ul>
<li>
Implementation of Schnorr-Euchner algorithms for
lattice basis reduction, including deep insertions and
block Korkin Zolotarev reduction.
These are significantly faster than the LLL algorithm
in NTL 1.0.

<li>
Implementation of arbitrary-precision floating point.

<li>
Implementation of double precision with extended exponent range,
which is useful for lattice basis reduction when the coefficients
are large.

<li>
Faster polynomial multiplication over the integers,
incorporating the Schoenhagge-Strassen method.

<li>
Compilation flags that increase performance on machines
with poor floating-point performance.

<li>
Sundry performance tuning and a few bug fixes.
