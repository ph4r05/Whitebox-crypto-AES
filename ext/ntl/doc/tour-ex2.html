A Tour of NTL: Examples: Vectors and Matrices
</p>
</h1>


<p> <hr> <p>


<p>
The following routine sums up the 
numbers in a vector of <tt>ZZ</tt>'s.

<pre>
#include &lt;NTL/ZZ.h&gt;
#include &lt;NTL/vector.h&gt;

using namespace std;
using namespace NTL;

ZZ sum(const Vec&lt;ZZ&gt;&amp; v)
{
   ZZ acc;

   acc = 0;

   for (long i = 0; i &lt; v.length(); i++)
      acc += v[i];

   return acc;
}
</pre>

<p>
The class <tt>Vec&lt;ZZ&gt;</tt> is a dynamic-length array of <tt>ZZ</tt>s;
more generally, NTL provides a template class  <tt>Vec&lt;T&gt;</tt>
for 
dynamic-length 
vectors over any type <tt>T</tt>.

Some history is in order here.
NTL predates the STL and the <tt>vector</tt> template
found in modern <tt>C++</tt>.
Older versions of NTL (prior to v6) did not use templates, but instead
defined generic vectors using macros.
By convention, NTL named these <tt>vec_T</tt>.
For backward compatibility, NTL now provides typedefs
all these "legacy" vector types.


<p>
Vectors in NTL are indexed from 0, but in many situations
it is convenient or more natural to index from 1.
The generic vector class allows for this;
the above example could be written as follows.

<pre>
#include &lt;NTL/ZZ.h&gt;
#include &lt;NTL/vector.h&gt;

using namespace std;
using namespace NTL;

ZZ sum(ZZ&amp; s, const Vec&lt;ZZ&gt;&amp; v)
{
   ZZ acc;

   acc = 0;

   for (long i = 1; i &lt;= v.length(); i++)
      acc += v(i); 

   return acc;
}
</pre>

<p>
Note that by default, NTL does not perform range checks on 
vector indices.
However, there is a compile-time flag that activates range checking.
Therefore, it is good practice to always assume that range checking 
may be activated, and to not access elements that are out of range.

<p> <hr> <p>

The following example illustrates vector I/O,
as well as changing the length of a vector.
This program reads a <tt>Vec&lt;ZZ&gt;</tt>,
and then creates and prints a "palindrome". 

<pre>
#include &lt;NTL/ZZ.h&gt;
#include &lt;NTL/vector.h&gt;

using namespace std;
using namespace NTL;

int main()
{
   Vec&lt;ZZ&gt; v;
   cin &gt;&gt; v;

   long n = v.length();
   v.SetLength(2*n);

   long i;
   for (i = 0 ; i < n; i++)
      v[n+i] = v[n-1-i];

   cout &lt;&lt; v &lt;&lt "\n";
}
</pre>

<p>

Notice that changing the length of a vector does not change
its contents.

<p>

When we compile and run this program,
if we type in
<pre>
   [1 -2 3]
</pre>
as input, the output is
<pre>
   [1 -2 3 3 -2 1]
</pre>

<p>

See <a href="vector.txt"><tt>vector.txt</tt></a> for
complete details of NTL's generic vector mechanism.

Also note that for several fundamental vector types, such as
<tt>Vec&lt;ZZ&gt;.txt</tt>, there is a corresponding header file
<tt>&lt;NTL/vec_ZZ.h&gt;</tt> that defines
a number of basic arithmetic operations,
as well as provides the typedef 
typedef <tt>vec_ZZ</tt> for backward compatibilty.
See <a href="vec_ZZ.txt"><tt>vec_ZZ.txt</tt></a> for
complete details on the arithmetic operations for <tt>Vec&lt;ZZ&gt;</tt>'s
provided by NTL.



<p> <hr> <p>

There is also basic support for matrices
in NTL.
In general, the class <tt>Mat&lt;T&gt;</tt> is a special
kind of <tt>Vec&lt; Vec&lt; T &gt; &gt;</tt>, where each row is 
a vector of the same length.
Row <tt>i</tt> of matrix <tt>M</tt>
can be accessed as <tt>M[i]</tt> (indexing from 0)
or as  <tt>M(i)</tt> (indexing from 1).
Column <tt>j</tt> of row <tt>i</tt> can be accessed
as <tt>M[i][j]</tt> or <tt>M(i)(j)</tt>;
for notational convenience, the latter is equivalent to <tt>M(i,j)</tt>.

<p>
Here is a matrix multiplication routine,
which in fact is already provided by NTL.

<pre>
#include &lt;NTL/ZZ.h&gt;
#include &lt;NTL/matrix.h&gt;

using namespace std;
using namespace NTL;

void mul(Mat&lt;ZZ&gt;&amp; X, const Mat&lt;ZZ&gt;&amp; A, const Mat&lt;ZZ&gt;&amp; B)
{
   long n = A.NumRows();
   long l = A.NumCols();
   long m = B.NumCols();

   if (l != B.NumRows())
      Error("matrix mul: dimension mismatch");

   X.SetDims(n, m); // make X have n rows and m columns

   long i, j, k;
   ZZ acc, tmp;

   for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
      for (j = 1; j &lt;= m; j++) {
         acc = 0;
         for(k = 1; k &lt;= l; k++) {
            mul(tmp, A(i,k), B(k,j));
            add(acc, acc, tmp);
         }
         X(i,j) = acc;
      }
   }
}
</pre>

<p>
In case of a dimension mismatch, the routine calls the 
<tt>Error</tt> function, which is a part of NTL and which simply
prints the message and aborts.
That is generally how NTL deals with errors.

<p>
This routine will not work properly if <tt>X</tt> aliases 
<tt>A</tt> or <tt>B</tt>.
The actual matrix multiplication routine in NTL takes care of this.
In fact, all of NTL's routines allow outputs to alias inputs.

<p>
To call NTL's built-in  multiplication routine
(declared in <tt>&lt;NTL/mat_ZZ.h&gt;</tt>), one can write 
<pre>
   mul(X, A, B);
</pre>
or one can also use the operator notation 
<pre>
   X = A * B;
</pre>

<p>
NTL provides several matrix types.
See <a href="matrix.txt"><tt>matrix.txt</tt></a>
for complete details on NTL's generic matrix mechanism.
Also see <a href="mat_ZZ.txt"><tt>mat_ZZ.txt</tt></a> for
complete details on the arithmetic operations for <tt>Mat&lt;ZZ&gt;</tt>'s
provideed by NTL (including basic linear algebra).
Also see <a href="LLL.txt"><tt>LLL.txt</tt></a> 
for details on routines for lattice basis reduction
(as well as routines for finding the kernel and image of a matrix).

<p>
One thing you may have noticed by now is that
NTL code generally avoids the type
<tt>int</tt>, preferring instead to use <tt>long</tt>.
This seems to go against what most "style" books preach,
but nevertheless seems to make the most sense in today's world.
Although <tt>int</tt> was originally meant to represent the
"natural" word size, this seems to no longer be the case.
On 32-bit machines, <tt>int</tt> and <tt>long</tt> 
are the same,
but on 64-bit machines, they are often different, with 
<tt>int</tt>'s having 32 bits and <tt>long</tt>'s having 64 bits. 
Indeed, there is a standard, called "LP64", which is being adopted
by all Unix-like systems, and which specifies that on 64-bit machines,
<tt>int</tt>'s have 32 bits, and <tt>long</tt>'s and pointers have 64 bits.
Moreover, on such 64-bit machines, 
the "natural" word size is usually 64-bits;
indeed, it is often more expensive to manipulate 32-bit integers.
Thus, for simplicity, efficiency,  and safety, NTL uses <tt>long</tt>
for all integer values.
If you are used to writing <tt>int</tt> all the time,
it takes a little while to get used to this.
