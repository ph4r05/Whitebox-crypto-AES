A Tour of NTL: Using NTL with the <tt>GF2X</tt> library
</p>
</h1>

<p> <hr> <p>

<tt>gf2x</tt> is a library for fast multiplication 
of polynomials over <i>GF(2)</i>.
The <tt>gf2x</tt> library was developed by Emmanuel Thom&eacute;,
Paul Zimmermmann, Pierrick Gaudry, and Richard Brent.
You can get more information about it, as well as the latest version
from <a href="http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/gf2x/">here.</a>

<p>

Unlike NTL, which only imlements a version of Karatsuba multiplication,
<tt>gf2x</tt> implements other algorithms that are faster
for very large degree polynomials.
If you use NTL if the <tt>gf2x</tt> library,
then multiplication, division, GCD, and minimum polynomal
calculations for the <a href="GF2X.txt">GF2X</a> class will 
be faster for large degree polymials.

<h2>
Downloading and building <tt>gf2x</tt>
</h2>
<p>

Download <tt>gf2x</tt> from <a href="http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/gf2x/">here.</a>
You will get a file <tt>gf2x-XXX.tar.gz</tt>.
<p>
Now do the following:
<pre>
   % gunzip gf2x-XXX.tar.gz
   % tar xf gf2x-XXX.tar
   % cd gf2x-XXX
   % ./configure --prefix=$HOME/sw
   % make
   % make check
   % make install
</pre>
This will build, test, and install <tt>gf2x</tt> in <tt>$HOME/sw</tt>.
Of course, change $HOME/sw to whatever you want (the default is 
<tt>/usr/local</tt>).
You will find the <tt>gf2x</tt> header files in <tt>$HOME/sw/include</tt> 
and the compiled binaries in <tt>$HOME/sw/lib</tt>.

<p>
You can also supply the option
<tt>--disable-shared</tt> to the <tt>configure</tt> script,
if you only want static libraries.
However, if you ultimately want to build NTL as a shared
library, then you must also buld <tt>gf2x</tt> as a shared library.

<p>
<p>
You must ensure that NTL and <tt>gf2x</tt> have the same 
<a href="tour-unix.html#abi">ABI</a>.
<tt>gf2x</tt>'s configuration script might need some
help to select the right one.
For example, you may have to pass
<pre>
   ABI=64 CFLAGS="-m64 -O2"
</pre>
to <tt>gf2x</tt>'s configure script to force a 64-bit ABI.





<p>
<h2>
Building and using NTL with <tt>gf2x</tt>
</h2>
<p>

When building NTL with <tt>gf2x</tt>, you have to tell NTL that you want to
use it.
The easiest way to do this is by passing the argument 
<tt>NTL_GF2X_LIB=on</tt> to the NTL configuration script
when you are <a href="tour-unix.html">installing NTL</a>.
Assuming you installed <tt>gf2x</tt> in <tt>$HOME/sw</tt> as above,
and you also want to install NTL in <tt>$HOME/sw</tt>,
you execute:
<pre>
   % ./configure PREFIX=$HOME/sw NTL_GF2X_LIB=on  GF2X_PREFIX=$HOME/sw
</pre>
You can write this more simply as 
<pre>
   % ./configure DEF_PREFIX=$HOME/sw NTL_GF2X_LIB=on 
</pre>
Here, <tt>DEF_PREFIX</tt> is a variable that is used
to specify the location of all software,
and it defaults to <tt>/usr/local</tt>.


<p>
If you installed <tt>gf2x</tt> in <tt>/usr/local</tt> (or some other
standard system directory where your compiler will look by default)
then simply
<pre>
   % ./configure PREFIX=$HOME/sw NTL_GF2X_LIB=on
</pre>
does the job.
Moreover, if NTL is also to be installed in <tt>/usr/local</tt>,
then
<pre>
   % ./configure NTL_GF2X_LIB=on
</pre>
does the job.

<p>
Instead of passing arguments to the configure script,
you can also just edit the <tt>config.h</tt> and <tt>makefile</tt> by hand.
The documentation in these files should be self-explanatory.


<p>
When compiling programs that use NTL with <tt>gf2x</tt>,
you need to link with the <tt>gf2x</tt> library.
If <tt>gf2x</tt> is installed as above in 
<tt>$HOME/sw</tt>, rather than in a standard system directory,
 this just means adding
<tt>-L$HOME/sw/lib -lgf2x</tt> to the compilation command.
If you installed <tt>gf2x</tt> in a standard system directory,
then just <tt>-lgf2x</tt> does the job.
Note that <tt>-lgf2x</tt> must come <i>after</i> <tt>-lntl</tt>
on the command line.
Finally, if NTL and <tt>gf2x</tt> are installed as
shared libraries, then you don't even need <tt>-lgf2x</tt>.
